# QED-Nano: Teaching a Tiny Model to Prove Hard Theorems

QED-Nano is a compact 4B-parameter language model explicitly post-trained for Olympiad-level mathematical proof generation. By combining high-quality supervised fine-tuning with long-horizon reinforcement learning and structured test-time compute, QED-Nano significantly strengthens proof-writing capabilities in small models.

Despite its size, QED-Nano closes much of the gap to large generalist systems by learning to reason over long horizons and effectively utilize additional computation at inference time. The training pipeline emphasizes data quality, curriculum design, and reinforcement learning objectives that directly optimize for rigorous step-by-step proof correctness.

This repository contains the full training and evaluation stack for QED-Nano, including curated Olympiad proof datasets, supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning code, and benchmarking tools for proof and answer-based evaluations. The goal is to provide a reproducible framework for studying long-horizon mathematical reasoning in compact language models and for enabling future research on compute-efficient reasoning systems.
